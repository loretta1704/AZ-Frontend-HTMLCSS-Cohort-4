       <p class="Objective">The objective of this page is to complete an  assignment of adding Css to Html to enhance the appearance and visual dynamics of an Html page and I would be using this assignment to talk about my favourite foods lol.Firstly, I'm a Ghananian, born and raised. Over time, I have gotten accustomed to the foods I grew up with but since I started growing up, I decided to try other foods to  experiment with food tastes,texture,spiciness etc. and aprreciate the cultural richness from other countries.</p>
